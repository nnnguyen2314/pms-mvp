## Membership Management and Authorization

The backend enforces simple role-based rules for managing workspace and project memberships.

Rules:
- Only workspace OWNER or ADMIN can add/remove members in a workspace.
- For a project, workspace OWNER/ADMIN or the project owner (the user who created the project) can add/remove project members.
- Regular members cannot self-join or leave workspaces/projects; there are no self-serve join/leave endpoints.

Database schema additions (applied via the schema tool):
- Table project_members (project_id, user_id, role text default 'MEMBER', joined_at, PK(project_id,user_id)).

Apply schema:
- From repo root: yarn build
- Then: (cd apps/backend && node ./dist/utils/run-sql.js apps/backend/db/pms.sql)

Seed default users and roles:
- A seed file is provided to create default user accounts and a Default Workspace with role assignments.
- Admin account email is set to: nhatnguyen.nguyen23@gmail.com

Run the seed:
- From repo root: yarn build
- Then: (cd apps/backend && node ./dist/utils/run-sql.js apps/backend/db/seed.sql)

Seeded records:
- Users (status=Active):
  - id=owner,  name=Owner User,  email=owner@example.com
  - id=admin,  name=Admin User,  email=nhatnguyen.nguyen23@gmail.com
  - id=member, name=Member User, email=member@example.com
  - id=guest,  name=Guest User,  email=guest@example.com
- Workspace:
  - id=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001, name=Default Workspace
- Workspace members:
  - owner => OWNER
  - admin => ADMIN
  - member => MEMBER
  - guest => GUEST

Endpoints (all require auth and live under /api):
- Workspace members:
  - POST /api/workspaces/:id/members
    - Body: { userId, role?: 'ADMIN'|'MEMBER'|'GUEST' }
    - Only workspace OWNER/ADMIN can call.
  - DELETE /api/workspaces/:id/members/:userId
    - Only workspace OWNER/ADMIN can call. Cannot remove OWNER.
- Project members:
  - POST /api/projects/:id/members
    - Body: { userId, role?: 'MEMBER'|'GUEST' }
    - Allowed for workspace OWNER/ADMIN of the parent workspace or the project owner.
  - DELETE /api/projects/:id/members/:userId
    - Same authorization as above.
